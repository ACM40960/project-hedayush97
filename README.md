### Dog Breed Image Recognition using AI

This repository contains **Python** code for predicting dog breeds from images using advanced deep learning models. After evaluating the performance of multiple models, **InceptionResNetV2** is chosen as the best-performing one, thereby using it for the main predictions.

## Motivation

The ability to accurately identify dog breeds from images is not only a fun and engaging challenge but also has practical applications in areas such as veterinary care, pet adoption, and even lost pet recovery. According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), there are nearly 200 recognized dog breeds, each with distinct characteristics and traits. For pet owners, veterinarians, and animal shelters, the ability to swiftly and accurately identify a dog's breed can significantly aid in understanding the pet's behavior, health predispositions, and care requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition. It contains thousands of images across various breeds, providing a robust foundation for training a deep learning model. The data is structured as follows: - **id**: The unique identifier for each image file. - **breed**: The breed of the dog in the image.

The dataset contains 10,222 images, each associated with one of 120 unique dog breeds.

## Machine Learning Models

The Python code in this repository leverages **TensorFlow**, **Keras** and other relevant libraries to implement and evaluate several deep learning models, including:

-   EfficientNetB4
-   InceptionResNetV2
-   MobileNetV2
-   Xception
-   DenseNet201
-   NASNetLarge

The code provides a comprehensive evaluation of each model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, loss, precision, recall, AUC , specificity, sensitivity and F1-score. After evaluation, InceptionResNetV2 is selected as the best-performing model for dog breed classification.

### 4) Testing with Custom Input

his model processes input images of shape $224 \times 224 \times 3$, and the final output consists of 120 classes, corresponding to different dog breeds. The inclusion of data augmentation and dropout layers helps in regularization, potentially reducing overfitting. The displayed images with predicted breeds and their probabilities provide a visual validation of the modelâ€™s effectiveness. The model demonstrates a strong capability to identify various dog breeds with high confidence, indicated by probability scores close to 1.0 for several breeds as seen below.
